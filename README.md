# RemoteRocketship Scraper

This Python script scrapes the RemoteRocketship advice section, extracts questions and answers, and saves them as individual PDF files. The script navigates through the website using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm and ensures that each page is only visited once.

## Features

- Scrapes the RemoteRocketship advice section for questions and answers.
- Saves each question and its corresponding answer(s) as a separate PDF file.
- Uses BFS to navigate the website and avoid revisiting pages.
- Provides progress updates after every 10 PDF files are saved.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- The following Python packages:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `fpdf`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/remoterocketship-scraper.git
   cd remoterocketship-scraper
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 fpdf
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

   The script will start from the base URL (https://www.remoterocketship.com/advice) and navigate through the website, scraping questions and answers, and saving them as PDF files in a directory structure that mirrors the website's structure.

2. **Output:**

   - PDF files will be saved in the specified directory structure.
   - The script will print progress updates after every 10 PDF files are saved.

## Customization

- **Base URL:** The starting URL for the scraper can be changed by modifying the `base_url` variable in the script.
- **Directory Structure:** The directory where PDF files are saved can be customized by modifying the `base_dir` variable in the script.
